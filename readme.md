# Personal Portfolio

This project is a starter Portfolio for myself. On this portfolio is a section about me, projects cards and contact information. Employers can link to my GitHub account as well as my LinkedIn account through the logo icons. All project cards currently link to my GitHub page as a place holders until projects have been completed.
